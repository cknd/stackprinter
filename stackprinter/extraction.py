    Get a frame representation that's easy to format


    Params
    ---
    tb: Traceback object or Frame object

    lineno: int (optional)
        Override which source line is treated as the important one. For trace-
        back objects this defaults to the last executed line (tb.tb_lineno).
        For frame objects, it defaults the currently executed one (fr.f_lineno).


    Returns
    ---
    FrameInfo, a named tuple with the following fields:

         filename: Path of the executed source file

         function: Name of the scope

         lineno: Highlighted line (last executed line)

         source_map: OrderedDict
            Maps line numbers to a list of tokens. Each token is a (string, type)
            tuple. Concatenating the first elements of all tokens of all lines
            restores the original source, weird whitespaces/indentations and all
            (in contrast to python's built-in `tokenize`). However, multiline
            statements (those with a trailing backslash) are secretly collapsed
            into their first line.

         head_lns: (int, int) or (None, None)
            Line numbers of the beginning and end of the function header

         line2names: dict
            Maps each line number to a list of variables names that occur there

         name2lines: dict
            Maps each variable name to a list of line numbers where it occurs

         assignments: OrderedDict
            Holds current values of all variables that occur in the source and
            are found in the given frame's locals or globals. Attribute lookups
            with dot notation are treated as one variable, so if `self.foo.zup`
            occurs in the source, this dict will get a key 'self.foo.zup' that
            holds the fully resolved value.
            (TODO: it would be easy to return the whole attribute lookup chain,
            so maybe just do that & let formatting decide which parts to show?)
            (TODO: Support []-lookups just like . lookups)
